## Speakers

### Without subwoofer

If you do <strong>not</strong> have the subwoofer, set both front-of-house
speakers like this:

### With subwoofer

If you <strong>do</strong> have the subwoofer, set as follows.

The subwoofer goes underneath one of the two speakers. The sound cable for that
speaker is daisy-chained through it: one of the speaker cable reels has an
extension cord attached which can be used for this.
